Description:
Introduction and Warm-up (Highly recommended)
Playing With Lists/Arrays Series
Task
Given an array of intgers , Find the minimum sum which is obtained from summing each Two integers product .

Notes
Array/list will contain positives only .
Array/list will always has even size
Input >> Output Examples
1- minSum({5,4,2,3}) ==> return (22)
Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product , 5*2 + 3*4 = 22
2- minSum({12,6,10,26,3,24}) ==> return (342)
Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product , 26*3 + 24*6 + 12*10 = 342
3- minSum({9,2,8,7,5,4,0,6}) ==> return (74)
Explanation:
The minimum sum obtained from summing each two integers product , 9*0 + 8*2 +7*4 +6*5 = 74
minSum({5,4,2,3}) // return 22

Explanation ::
5*2 +3*4 = 22

minSum({12,6,10,26,3,24}) // return 342

Explanation ::
26*3 + 24*6 + 12*10 = 342

minSum({9,2,8,7,5,4,0,6}) // return 74

Explanation ::
9*0 + 8*2 +7*4 +6*5 = 74
